#  Art Gallery Web Application

##  Project Description
The Art Gallery Web Application is a beginner-friendly full-stack project developed using React.js for the frontend and Node.js for the backend. The application allows users to browse artworks and perform buy and sell actions at a UI level, simulating a basic online art marketplace.

This project was built to strengthen my understanding of React fundamentals, component-based architecture, and basic frontend–backend integration.
